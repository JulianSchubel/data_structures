TREES:
    Hierarchical
    Each data element a node
    Links between nodes called edges
    
Use cases:
    When data is connected and hierarchical in nature
    Compiler
    Writing programs as an abstract syntax tree
    File systems
    Can assist with accessing data more quickly (binary search tree)
    Trees lend themselves very well to recursion (an action on a tree works just as well on the sub-trees).

Pre-order traversal:
    Data in node, then left subtree, then right subtree
    Called "pre-order" because the data comes before (pre)
